If you would like to convert an video to different format, here is a tool for you.

To use this, install ffmpeg-python first ```pip install ffmpeg-python```

For linux use ```sudo apt install ffmpeg``` (ubuntu tested)
For MacOS use ```brew install ffmpeg```
For Winfows ```install based on website```

- Run python code in terminal, enter absolute filepath (right click on the file in file explorer, copy absolute path in properties)
- Enter desired format to convert into
- wait for the conversion
- enjoy the movie

Usage for avi to mkv works very well
